Applications and file systems regulate how blocks are accessed, combined and modified. Break up data into blocks and then stores those blocks as separate pieces, each with unique identifier. They are stored wherever it is most efficient. Thus, it can store those blocks across different systems and each block can be configured to work with different operating systems. 1.2 File storageFile storage is a methodology that help users, applications, and services access data in a shared file system. Data is stored in a hierarchical structure. This structure is similar to a centralized shared network drive in a company where employees store and access files 1.3 Object storageFiles are stored as objects based on attributes and metadata. Each object consists of data, metadata and an object key. The metadata has information about the data (object size, object purpose and more). The object key is the unique identifier of the object. When you update files in object storage, the entire file object is updated, instead of a piece of a file, as in block storage 2. Use cases2.1 Block storage: consistent and low-latency performanceHosting database instances: SAP HANA. Oracle, SQL,..

<ul>
<li>Data is stored on a device in <strong>fixed-sized block</strong>.</li>
<li>Applications and file systems regulate how blocks are accessed, combined and modified.</li>
<li>Break up data into blocks and then stores those blocks as separate pieces, each with unique identifier.</li>
<li>They are stored wherever it is most efficient. Thus, it can store those blocks across different systems and each block can be configured to work with different operating systems.</li>

<ul>
<li>File storage is a methodology that help users, applications, and services access data in a shared file system.</li>
<li>Data is stored in a <strong>hierarchical structure</strong>. This structure is similar to a centralized shared network drive in a company where employees store and access files</li>

<ul>
<li>Files are stored as <strong>objects</strong> based on attributes and metadata.</li>
<li>Each object consists of data, metadata and an object key.</li>
<li>The metadata has information about the data (object size, object purpose and more).</li>
<li>The object key is the unique identifier of the object. When you update files in object storage, the entire file object is updated, instead of a piece of a file, as in block storage</li>

<li>Data availability: automatically replicated within its AZ. Attach EBS to EC2 instance in same AZ → same hard drive or physical device.</li>
<li>Data persistence: off-instance storage, pay for the volume usage as long as the data persists. Automatically detach from instance, quick recovery. The volume remains attached throughout the stop-start cycle.</li>
<li>Data encryption: all EBS volume types support encryption AES-256 and Amazon-managed key infrastructure.</li>
<li>Data security: EBS volume are presented to you as raw, unformatted block devices. These devices are logical devices that are created on the EBS infrastructure. The Amazon EBS service verifies that the devices are logically empty prior to any use or reuse by a customer.</li>
<li>Snapshots: back up EBS to S3, snapshots are incremental backups which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed</li>
