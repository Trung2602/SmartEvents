Break up data into blocks and then stores those blocks as separate pieces, each with unique identifier. They are stored wherever it is most efficient. Thus, it can store those blocks across different systems and each block can be configured to work with different operating systems. 1.2 File storage\rFile storage is a methodology that help users, applications, and services access data in a shared file system. Data is stored in a hierarchical structure. This structure is similar to a centralized shared network drive in a company where employees store and access files 1.3 Object storage\rFiles are stored as objects based on attributes and metadata. Each object consists of data, metadata and an object key. The metadata has information about the data (object size, object purpose and more). The object key is the unique identifier of the object. When you update files in object storage, the entire file object is updated, instead of a piece of a file, as in block storage 2.

Your user agreement permits a user to access the video thumbnail for one year. However, your usage data indicates that most thumbnail previews are not often accessed after 60 days but must be accessed quickly.\nNote → Amazon S3 Standard-IA: using S3-IA gives users quick access to the thumbnail but saves costs. Consider using a lifecycle policy to move the thumbnail into archive storage after 60 days.\nCase 2:\rA business wants to implement stronger business continuity practices and keep backups of their data for a long period of time. They do not anticipate needing to access the data often. But they want to be able to have the data within a few hours in the event of disaster recovery.\nNote → S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval: is a low-cost option for long-term storage. Data can be retrieved in a number of hours with standard retrieval or 1-5 minutes with expedited retrieval.\nCase 3:\rA company builds a cloud-native application with Amazon S3 storage for school exams. The application gets some use during the school term but then is used very heavily during the exam season near the end of the term. The application has unpredictable use patterns, and the company is trying to control costs.\nNote → S3 Intelligent-Tiering: should be used when workloads are unpredictable. S3 Intelligent-Tiering will optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier when access patterns change.\n6. Amazon S3 costs\r6.1 Amazon EBS key features and benefits\rData availability: automatically replicated within its AZ. Attach EBS to EC2 instance in same AZ → same hard drive or physical device. Data persistence: off-instance storage, pay for the volume usage as long as the data persists. Automatically detach from instance, quick recovery. The volume remains attached throughout the stop-start cycle. Data encryption: all EBS volume types support encryption AES-256 and Amazon-managed key infrastructure. Data security: EBS volume are presented to you as raw, unformatted block devices. These devices are logical devices that are created on the EBS infrastructure. The Amazon EBS service verifies that the devices are logically empty prior to any use or reuse by a customer. Snapshots: back up EBS to S3, snapshots are incremental backups which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed Flexibility: which means that you can make changes without service interruptions 6.2 Amazon EBS volume types\rSSD:\rGeneral purpose: balance of price and performance suitable for most workloads\nTransactional workloads Virtual desktops Medium-sized databases Low-latency interactive applications Boot volumes Development and test environments Provisioned IOPS: high performance for mission-critical, low-latency, or high-throughput workloads\nWorkloads that require sustained IOPS performance. I/O-intensive database workload HDD:\rThroughput optimized HDD: low-cost HDD for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads.\nBig data Data warehouses Log processing Cold HDD: the lowest-cost HDD design for less frequently accessed workloads.\nThroughput-oriented storage for data that is infrequently accessed. Scenarios where the lowest storage cost is important. 6.3 File storage on AWS\rFully managed: fully managed service, AWS does all (manage files server, storage, updating HW, config sw, performing backups) Highly available and durable: 11 9s (99.999 999 999%) durability and 99.99% of availability Elastic and scalable: storage capacity is elastic, grows or shrinks..

What is computing?\r1.1 Components\rCPU:\nRuns and processes the instructions that it is given RAM:\nStores data that the computer needs to carry out processing tasks Temporary storage Hard drive:\nLong-term storage Stores the boot files and files that you create Network performance: Measured by\nBandwidth: the amount of data that can be sent over a specified time Latency: How long it takes the data to travel 1.2 Benefits of cloud computing\rSave on costs:\nNo upfront costs Pay for only what you use No data centers to maintain Scalable:\nScale up or down as needs change No need to guess capacity Provision resources as needed Reliable:\nReliable services Build for fault tolerance Application integrity 2. Computing methods\r2.1 Instances\rAn instance, or virtual machine, is a computing resource in the cloud. It works like a traditional on-premises server. It can support workloads such as web hosting, applications, databases, authentication services, and anything else a server can do. You choose the operating system (OS), CPU, memory, storage and other components, and in a few minutes, your instance is ready to use. As soon as you’re done, you can stop or terminate the instances. You’re not locked in or stuck with servers that you don’t need or want. You can treat instances as temporary and disposable computing resources, free from the inflexibility and constraints of a fixed and finite IT infrastructure. 2.2 Instance use cases:\rHosting environment Development and testing environments Backup and disaster recovery 2.3 Containers\rContainers are method of OS virtualization that you can use to run an application and its dependencies in resource-isolated processes. By using containers, you can package an application’s code, configurations, and dependencies into simple building blocks that deliver environmental consistency, operational efficiency, developer productivity, and version control. Containers are smaller than virtual machines and do not contain an entire operating system. Instead, containers share a virtualized OS and run as resource-isolated processes, which ensure quick, reliable, and consistent deployments. Containers hold everything that the software needs to run, such as libraries, system tools, code, and the runtime. 2.4 Container use cases:\rBuilding microservices architecture Video rendering services Quick development and deployment 2.5 Serverless\rServerless computing gives you the ability to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Serverless computing features automatic scaling, built-in high availability, and a pay-for-use billing model to increase agility and optimize costs. Serverless also eliminates infrastructure management tasks like capacity provisioning and patching, so you can focus on writing code that servers your customers. 2.6 Serverless use cases\rFile processing Web applications Mobile backends Cron jobs (scheduled computing tasks) 2.7 Hybrid\rIn a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. You might want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises. For example, suppose that a company wants to use cloud services that can automate batch data processing and analytics. However, the company has several legacy applications that are more suitable on premises and will not be migrated to the cloud. With a hybrid deployment, the company could keep the legacy applications on premises while benefiting from the data and analytics services that run in the cloud. 2.8 Hybrid use cases:\rLegacy applications Company regulatory requirements Government regulatory requirements 3. AWS computing services\r3.1. Amazon EC2\rAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure and resized compute capacity in the cloud. You can use it to provision virtual servers that are called Amazon EC2 instances, which can handle almost any computing need. With EC2 you can do the following: Provision and launch one or more EC2 instances in minutes. Stop or shutdown EC2 instances when you finish running a workload. Pay for only the compute time that you use when running an instance. 3.2. AWS Lambda\rAWS lambda is a serverless compute service that helps you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay for only the compute time you consume, and you incur no charges when your code isn’t running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration. You need only to upload your code, and Lambda manages everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically launch from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app. 3.3. Amazon ECS\rAmazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable and high-preformance container management system. It helps customers create new containers and manage them across EC2 instances. Amazon ECS supports Docker containers. Docker is a software platform that packages software (such as applications) into containers. To manage your containers, you must install an open-source Amazon ECS container agent on your EC2 instances. This agent is referred to as a container instance. You can run this agent on both Linux and Windows Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Amazon ECS uses API calls to control Docker-enabled applications. 3.4. Amazon EKS\rAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) provides the flexibility to start, run, and scale Kubernetes applications in the AWS Cloud or on premises. Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized applications. It is portable and extensible. With Amazon EKS, you can provide highly available and secure clusters. It automates patching, node provisioning, and updates. 3.5. AWS Fargate\rAWS Fragate is a serverless compute engine for containers. It supports both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS architectures. Fargate allocates the right amount of compute, which reduces the need to manage EC2 instances, cluster capacity, and scaling. 3.6. AWS Elastic Beanstalk\rAWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications. You can upload your code, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployments, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time. There’s no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk; you pay for only the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications.",
